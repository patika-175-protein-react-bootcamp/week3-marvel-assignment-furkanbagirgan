# Week 3 Assignment
In this assignment, a project that displays the characters on the screen using the Marvel API has been realized. The characters on the pages that the user clicks for the first time are drawn from the api and displayed. The characters on the pages that the user has previously clicked are saved in session storage. When returning to that page, the characters are taken from the session storage without connecting to the API and displayed on the screen.
